Simple app to keep track of books you want to read, are currently reading, or have already read. All with a nice and simple UI. Books are fetched from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).

If you want to use it, send me an email via the Homepage button.

## Why

Because I want to build a relatively simple CRUD app testing different technologies.

So every subfolder is the same app, with some improvements, built with a different stack.

## Demo

If you want to try it out, you can use the following credentials:

- Email: `test@matteotagliatti.it`
- Password: `test1234`
